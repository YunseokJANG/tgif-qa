## Description

Each file is matched with the Table 1 in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04497), with 'SPLIT_QTYPE_question.tsv' (tab separated file) format, and the first line of each tsv file includes the header. It follows 'gif_name	question	[multiple choices]	answer	[type]	vid_id	[extra]' format depends on each type. Note that 0/1/2/3 in '[type]' of 'frameqa' QTYPE are matched with Object/Number/Color/Location (same as [COCO-QA question generator](https://github.com/renmengye/imageqa-qgen) ).
